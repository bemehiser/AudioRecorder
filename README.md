# Audio Recorder

This sound recorder is a project which I have been wanting to begin for some time.
I volunteer to run sound at my local Christian church. During my time as a volunteer
we have used many applications to record sound. However, almost all of them were
designed for recording songs which consist of many tracks overlayed into a single
track, such as Audacity. What we need is a recorder which allows you to record a contiguous
service, consisting of a song, sermonette, song, announcements, special music, sermon, and
song, and afterwards the ability to cut this single track into multiple tracks for upload
to our website.

My plans are as follows:
1. recording functionality
2. editing functionality
3. metadata functionality
4. sqlite archive/web server sync

I hope this app will both add to my understanding of Android mobile development, as well
provide a simple functional sound recorder for my church and other church congragations.
